**Assessing project plan clarity and feasibility**
codex
## Strengths
- Clear articulation of the problem space and desired state for engineering and science students.
- Well-structured user stories with basic acceptance criteria covering core workflows (trig, history, statistics, unit conversion, mobile).
- Comprehensive non-functional requirements touching performance, accessibility, and security.
- Thoughtful risk register with mitigation strategies tied to calculation accuracy and performance.
- Launch/testing strategy outlines multiple layers of validation (unit, integration, E2E, UAT).

## Issues
- Major: Scope/timeline misalignment — P0 features plus testing and accessibility work within 1–2 weeks is unrealistic, especially for a first release with mobile parity and statistics/unit conversion.
- Major: KPI targets lack acquisition or baseline assumptions; 100 DAU by Week 4 and 40% mobile share without a go-to-market plan set the team up for perceived failure.
- Major: Security requirement “Local storage encrypted for history data” conflicts with the “fully client-side” constraint; browsers do not provide built-in encryption and key management here.
- Major: Statistical analysis story/requirements do not clarify how users input datasets (manual entry, CSV paste, uploads) or supported limits, risking unusable UX.
- Major: History persistence acceptance criteria mandate localStorage without specifying storage management, size limits, or behavior when full; requirement clashes with non-functional limit of 100 entries.
- Minor: Unit conversion story omits precision/rounding rules per unit (e.g., temperature decimals), which can cause inconsistent results vs. physical calculators.
- Minor: Success metrics include performance targets (<2s load, <100ms calc) but lack measurement methodology or environment definition (e.g., device class, network throttling).

## Suggestions
- Re-scope: 1) Deliver core calculator + angle toggle + responsive layout in Week 1; 2) add history (without persistence) and statistics basic mean/σ in Week 2; defer unit conversion/statistics variants to P1 unless timeline expands.
- Clarify KPI plan: 1) Define acquisition channels or internal pilot cohort size; 2) set leading indicators (e.g., weekly active beta users, task completion) before DAU targets.
- Resolve security requirement: either drop client-side encryption or introduce a lightweight backend/key service; document trade-offs explicitly.
- Expand data entry specs: describe dataset input UX (array builder, CSV paste, delimiter support), validation messaging, and max data points.
- Align history requirement: specify retention policy (e.g., most recent 100 calculations, FIFO removal) and behavior when storage fails; ensure acceptance criteria match non-functional constraints.
- Detail conversion precision: provide rounding rules per unit category and acceptance tests to mirror expected scientific calculator outputs.
- Document performance measurement setup (device profiles, throttling, tooling) so engineering/test know how to certify the KPI.
