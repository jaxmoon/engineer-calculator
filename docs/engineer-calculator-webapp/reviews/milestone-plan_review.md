**Preparing critique structure**
codex
## Strengths
- Clear roll-up of total token budget per component vs. overall target, making it easy to spot scope creep.
- Provides early visibility into which areas (e.g., Calculator Engine, Unit Conversion Engine) are the largest contributors to context usage.

## Issues
- **Critical** – Architecture/design decisions are absent; the doc lists components and token counts but never describes how they interact, technologies used, or why the breakdown is appropriate.
- **Critical** – No API design or data model details; we can’t validate interfaces between UI, store, engine, or persistence layers, nor confirm consistency of data contracts.
- **Critical** – Security is not discussed; persistence via localStorage and keyboard handlers raise questions about input sanitization, storage limits, and potential abuse.
- **Major** – Performance and scalability are unaddressed; no analysis of algorithmic complexity, memoization, batching, lazy loading, or constraints like large history payloads.
- **Major** – Testing strategy is effectively “line counts”; there’s no coverage goals, testing types, tooling, or automation plan to ensure quality.
- **Major** – Technical risks (e.g., math precision, localization, state synchronization, browser storage caps) aren’t identified; we can’t plan mitigations.
- **Minor** – Context quota alone may be insufficient; we don’t know assumptions (token estimator accuracy, compression by tooling) or how overflow is handled.

## Suggestions
1. Add an architectural overview: diagram or narrative showing UI, state, engines, persistence, and how data flows between them.
2. Document APIs/data contracts for each boundary (UI ↔ store, store ↔ engines, history service schema) including type definitions and error handling.
3. Expand security considerations: input validation strategy, protection from malformed formulas, safe use of localStorage, and privacy constraints.
4. Provide performance plans: expected complexity, caching/memoization, caps on history size, and responsiveness targets for heavy calculations.
5. Replace line/token counts with a real testing strategy: unit/integration/end-to-end breakdown, coverage goals, test data volume, automation pipeline, and negative test cases.
6. Enumerate technical risks with impact/likelihood and mitigations (precision errors, state desync, localization, reliance on browser features, 70k token milestone stretch).
