## User Experience
### User Flow
```
Landing Page → Calculator Interface → Perform Calculation → View Result
                      ↓                        ↓
                History Panel             Unit Converter
                      ↓                        ↓
                Review History          Convert Units → View Result
                      ↓
                Click History Item → Load into Calculator
```

### Key Interactions
1. **Basic Calculation**: User clicks buttons or types on keyboard → Expression builds in display → Press equals → Result shown
2. **History Access**: User clicks history icon → Side panel opens → Shows list of past calculations → Click item to reload
3. **Unit Conversion**: User selects conversion category → Enters value and source unit → Selects target unit → Conversion result displayed
4. **Mode Switching**: User toggles between degrees/radians → All trigonometric calculations use selected mode

### UI/UX Considerations

  - Must work on browsers supporting ES6+ (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
  - No server-side calculation processing (client-side only)
  - History storage limited by browser localStorage (~5-10MB)

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Calculation accuracy issues with floating-point arithmetic | High | High | Use dedicated math library (Math.js) with arbitrary precision support |
| Poor mobile performance on low-end devices | Medium | Medium | Optimize bundle size, lazy load non-critical features, performance testing on low-end devices |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Use modern build tools (Next.js), polyfills where needed, comprehensive browser testing |
| LocalStorage data loss or corruption | Low | Medium | Implement data validation, export/import functionality, graceful degradation |
| Complex UI overwhelming users | Low | High | User testing with target students, iterative UI refinement, progressive disclosure |

## Open Questions
1. Should we support complex numbers in the initial release or defer to P1?
